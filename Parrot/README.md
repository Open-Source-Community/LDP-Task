+ Parrot is recommended for users who are passionate about customization
    + Custom Kernel: Along with all the giant catalog of scripts, parrot security has its own hardened Linux kernel, modified explicitly to provide as much security and resistance to hackers as possible as the first line of defense.

    + Customizable Desktop: They provide a choice between two different desktop environments, MATE, which comes pre-installed by default, and KDE. You can think of desktop environments as the main UI for a Linux distribution for those unfamiliar with Linux terminology.
