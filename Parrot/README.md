# Installation
## How to install Parrot OS
#### There are 4 ways for doing that 
* Live USB Mode
* Virtualization (virtual machine)
    + Virtual Box
    + VMware
* HardDisk Installation
* Dual-Boot with windows

#### Now we will explain How to install Parrot in Virtualbox
1. First We need to Download and install Virtual Box
    * You can download it from [VirtualBox](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.6/VirtualBox-7.0.6-155176-Win.exe)

2. You need to download Parrot OS installation images

1. Open the virtual box and click on the New Button.

![firstphoto](imgs/1.png)

4. Give the name to your virtual machine, add Machine Folder, Type=Linux, and version as Debian (64-bit).Click on next.
A machine folder is the location where the instance of your virtual os is saved. You don’t need to provide it, it will select its default location automatically.

![firstphoto](imgs/2.png)

5. Now, to allot the RAM size for a virtual machine, if you have 4GB RAM, give a Memory Size of 15045MB RAM at least so that your virtual machine, as well as your local machine both, can work smoothly. For 8GB RAM and above can give a memory size of 2048MB to 4096MB. Click on next.

![firstphoto](imgs/3.png)

6. Select the option “Create a virtual hard disk now” and then click on Create button.
