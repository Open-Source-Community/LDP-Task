### Extra : 
	EndeavourOS is a great operating system, but it may not be the right fit for everyone. It requires some technical knowledge and skill to install and configure, so if you're not comfortable with that then it might be best to look at other options. Additionally, EndeavourOS might not have all the features you need or want in an operating system. It's important to do your research before downloading any OS so you're sure it meets the needs of your computer and your usage.
