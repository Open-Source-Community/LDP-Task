# Ubuntu Distribution: Who's it For? & Who's it Not For?

## I have always recommended Ubuntu to new Linux users because it has all the software most will need for general computer use. Also it seems to have the most documentation online when running into issues.

#### Ubuntu is a great system, as are all Linux distros. It just depends on what you are looking for. Need something super light weight for a old garbage laptop?... Puppy Linux. Something that has your cybersecurity wants/needs pre installed?.... Kali or Parrot. A Linux distro to get you started?.... Ubuntu or Mint

#### when it comes to ease of use and beginner-friendliness, Ubuntu is the name that pops up the most. Why is this so? And why do people recommend Ubuntu as the first distro to Linux beginners? Let's find out.

## Ubuntu is good for whom?
+ Amateur users with little to no Linux experience
    * it's easy to set up and use.
    * User-Friendly: It's a wonderful Linux distribution to start with—and if  you're pleased with it.

+ Ubuntu is a Linux distro based on Debian. It is suitable for cloud computing, servers, desktops, and internet of things (IoT) devices. 

+ It's much used in servers especially web servers

+ It is really helpful and good for the users who 
    * Improve the speed of communication through distributed computing.
    * work in Robotics field
    * are in University education
    * work in Software development

+ Ubuntu has proven to be the best option for Developers. This is because it supports new technology like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning.

    * Ubuntu is known to be a preferred choice for programmers. This is mainly because it is an Open source Operating system, and this allows the programmers to deeply understand the working of this operating system.

    * The terminal can be used for all kinds of programming and no third-party application is needed as in the case with Windows.

+ Yes. It's good For writing, Net surfing, email, pic, sound and video editing it’s as good as anything out there. 

+ Perfect for users with newer hardware and desktop needs

+ It is available free of cost for both personal and professional use.

+ When Ubuntu Operating System needs to be updated, the users do not need to restart the machine as the updates can easily run in the background. This in turn makes Ubuntu a preferred choice for services like Server.

+ Although it was designed primarily for personal computers, you may also use it on servers. GNOME, a graphical user interface and suite of desktop apps for Linux, is used in the standard version of Ubuntu. GNOME is designed to be comparable to the Windows desktop experience to make Linux easier for non-programmers.

+ Ubuntu is available in three different editions such as Desktop, Core, and Server versions. The Core edition is for IoT devices and robots. The developer of Ubuntu is Canonical and the founder, Mark Shuttleworth, might have never imagined the popularity Ubuntu gets now. 

+ Boost the old devices can be laptops and desktops.

+ What does a typical computer user want from a desktop (or laptop) operating system? They want a reliable, easy to maintain, easy to understand, simple to use operating system that makes it easy for them to access the small number of apps that they use on a regular basis. Ubuntu is that operating system. For such people, Ubuntu is brilliant. In terms of reliability and each of use, it is, I suggest, light years ahead of any version of Windows.
    * In Linux terms, lots of people use Ubuntu. Most people who use Ubuntu probably love it. They probably think it's wonderful. It is a great operating system for a typical computer user.

+ Users who are passionate about security
    * Ubuntu gets a new release every six months, and Long-Term Support (LTS) releases in every two years. Canonical gives security updates and support with each Ubuntu release.

    * Corporate Backing: Canonical is in charge of releasing six-monthly landmark releases and periodic LTS releases for enterprise business usage, as well as security patches, support, and the overall online architecture for community involvement. Canonical is trusted by businesses to maintain, protect, and manage Ubuntu systems and devices.

+ I use Ubuntu in the server space. It’s reliable and well supported.

- Gnome Linux (Ubuntu) currently doesn’t work well with QT5 GUI apps. That’s why many apps, such as Zoom, get stuck and are unusable.
    * Lack of GUI suppport. Gnome Linux (Ubuntu) currently doesn’t work well with QT5 GUI apps. That’s why many apps, such as Zoom, get stuck and are unusable

- users who respect privacy
