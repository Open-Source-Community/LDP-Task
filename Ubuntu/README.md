- ## What's it based on ?
    Ubuntu is based on Debian.

- ## History of it 
    - ### Brief Description
        Ubuntu is one of the most popular and widely used Linux distributions in 
        the  world, thanks to its user-friendliness, elegant and simple UI, and a
        large online community that provides support and solutions to common user
        problems. As a result, over the years, Ubuntu has become one of the most 
        recommended Linux distributions for beginners.

    - ### What's it based on ? (Story)
        The source code that makes up the Ubuntu Linux distribution originates 
        from another, much older Linux distribution known as Debian. Debian is 
        still a widely respected operating system but came under criticism for 
        infrequent updates and less than user friendly installation and 
        maintenance.

        A South African internet mogul decided it was time for a more user 
        friendly Linux. He took the Debian distribution and worked to make it a
        more human friendly distribution which he called Ubuntu. He subsequently
        formed a company called Canonical Ltd to promote and provide support for
        Ubuntu Linux. In addition Shuttleworth has formed and funded a foundation
        to guarantee the future of Ubuntu.

    - ### Ubuntu meaning
        Ubuntu Linux derives its name from ‘Ubuntu’, a South African word that
        means ‘I am because you are’. This is a translation to mean that we become
        who we are through other people and denotes the spirit of togetherness.

    The rest, as they say, is history. Ubuntu has since gone from strength to 
    strength. Dell and other hardware vendors now ship computers pre-loaded with 
    Ubuntu Linux and Ubuntu usually <strong> tops </strong> the chart at 
    DistroWatch.com (a web site which tracks the popularity of the various Linux
    distributions).

    If you are new to Linux, or already use Linux and want to try a different 
    Linux distro it is unlikely you will find a better option than Ubuntu Linux.
